        <p>
            In this project, I used a JavaScript library called Processing.js. Processing.js is the sister project of Processing, a Java library. Both libraries were created for the purpose of creating and designing digital art using code.

        <p>
            The first thing that was needed was to set up the Processing.js environment. Due to the limitations of chromebooks, we used C9, a freeware coding environment. I also set up a GitHub repository in order to have a backup in case something happened. This
            repository also came in handy when I started working on this project at home. While c9 was definitely one of the best options for in-school work, I had better options when I was at home. When I worked at home, I used WebStorm, a JetBrains
            product. I chose this particular IDE because I frequently used its Java counterpart, IntelliJ, and because it has build-in VCS support, meaning that it was easy to set up integration for GitHub, which therefore allowed me to work in school,
            commit and push my code, and then pull if from home and continue work.
