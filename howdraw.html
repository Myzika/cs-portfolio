        <!--Explanation of Processing-->

        <p>
            In this project, I used a JavaScript library called Processing.js. Processing.js is the sister project of Processing, a 
            Java library. Both libraries were created for the purpose of creating and designing digital art using code.

        <!--How the environment was set up-->

        <img class="logo" src="http://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/webstorm/img/meta/webstorm_logo_300x300.png" alt="WebStorm Logo" width=200 />
        <p>
            The first thing that was needed was to set up the Processing.js environment. Due to the limitations of chromebooks, 
            we used C9, a freeware coding environment. I also set up a GitHub repository in order to have a backup in case something happened. This
            repository also came in handy when I started working on this project at home. While c9 was definitely one of the best 
            options for in-school work, I had better options when I was at home. When I worked at home, I used WebStorm, a JetBrains
            product. I chose this particular IDE because I frequently used its Java counterpart, IntelliJ, and because it has 
            built-in VCS support, meaning that it was easy to set up integration for GitHub, which therefore allowed me to work in school,
            commit and push my code, and then pull it from home and continue work.
        </p>
        
        <!--How I chose what I was going to make-->

        <p>
            Then, I had to approach the project. What was I going to make, and how was I going to make it? I was inspired by two 
            different things The first thing is the Visual Arts class was working on making landscapes. This drew my interest, because I remembered 
            doing that project last year. The second thing was that in Minecraft, for one of the servers that I develop for, the 
            builders’ current project was to build dozens of trees. This was what made me truly decide to work on making a landscape. 
        </p>
        
        <!--Organizational strategy-->
        <img src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/EW5Yx897QIm6VSQz7mAYpw.png" alt="cs-portfolio/int2checkpoints/testing/"></img>
        <p>
            I first organized my workspace. Because I wanted to be able to change things and mess with things without breaking the 
            entire project, I moved the Processing setup into a folder that I named ‘testing’. Here, I began to put the project together.
        </p>
        
        <!--The ground-->
        <img class="logo" src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/W5RFs9sHQXK9cgChyt4t6Q.png" alt="Lumpy Ground"></img>
        <img class="logo" src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/5-r3Z8OcQGO-uW1wdUnDtA.png" alt="Code image"></img>
        <p>
            The first part of any landscape is the ground. I made a function specifically for the ground, calling it ground(). I 
            decided that I wanted my ground to be slightly lumpy, and not completely straight. To do this, I first used a single 
            ellipse shape to plot out the height and coordinates of the ground. An ellipse’s parameters are the x and y of its center,
            and the length and height of the ellipse. After I figured out the height of the circle, I placed this code inside of a 
            for loop, and inside of this for loop, I increased the x value each time it ran, creating a long stretch of circles along
            the bottom of the page. After doing this, however, the circles were so close to each other that it looked like nothing 
            more than just a straight line. Therefore, I changed the value of the incrementor to 50, which was a good level of spacing 
            between the circles. At this point, the circles still had borders, so I got rid of the borders using the noStroke() function.
        </p>
        
        <!--Tree Trunk-->

        <p>
            After I finished the ground, I decided to start working on my trees. After looking at the structure of a tree, I decided 
            that the best method of organization would be to separate the trees into different functions. As I started work on the 
            first base tree, I noticed that it was quite difficult to tell line and shape apart, so I split up the code even more, 
            separating the first tree into three parts: trunk, branches, and leaves. The first part of this tree that I tackled was 
            the trunk. This would turn out to be the hardest part of the tree to complete due to its curved shape. After I got the 
            very basic shape down, I used variables to fine-tune the numbers. Finally, I got rid of the fill, and increased the 
            stroke weight. This was done because the trunk itself was a bezier curve, which is, essentially, a curved line. I called 
            the ground function and took a look. The tree trunk still didn’t look quite right to me. I pulled up a picture of a tree, 
            and looked closely. Then, I realized it was because my tree trunk stayed the same width the entire length of it. To fix 
            this, I used a triangle to make the trunk taper downwards. 
        </p>
        
        <!--Tree Branches-->
        <img class="other" height=400px src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/4fl5DnRGSNm-tuMfdaYkTg.png" alt="Branches code"></img>
        <img class="other" height=400px src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/0BKxXk43Tza8Lm5znuYV5g.png" alt="tree with no leaves"></img>
        <p>
            Then, I started working on the tree branches. The majority of the branches were made of triangles. While I could have 
            used lines for all of the branches, the tapered shape that the triangles provided had a nicer, more branch-like look 
            that I preferred. I split up the larger, main branches that connected to the trunk, and the smaller branches that built 
            off of that.
        </p>
        
        <!--Tree Leaves-->
        <img class="other" alt="tree" src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/IMrxczMlTy_chHbsXSQ9AQ.png"></img>
        <img class="other" src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/UQLQQDHOTgGbW0TsKNE3rQ.png" alt="tree code"></img>
        <p>
            After this, I began work on the foliage. I placed all of the leaves in a function called “leaves”. My leaves were long 
            ellipses that centered around each main branch. After I did these main leaves, I noted that my tree still looked quite 
            bare. To fix this, I centered two larger ellipses over the entire top of the trees, and I gave them a lower transparency. 
            Then, I varied the shades of green for the leaves.
        </p>
        
        <!--Tree duplication-->

        <p>
            Finally, now having a finished tree, I copied the code several times, and I used variables to add trees in various other
            areas. Each new tree had a function inside of their tree part.
