        <h2>About me!</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Brianna Wong, and I am a 15-year-old sophomore at Summit Shasta High School.</p>
        <img id="genderqueer" src="https://uniteuk1.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/img_2495.jpg" width="25%">
        <p>I am asexual, demiromantic, and panromantic. This means that I do not experience sexual attraction, that I need to have a platonic relationship with someone before I will experience romantic attraction to them, and that I do not care what gender
            someone is.</p>

        <p>I am genderqueer and non-binary, although I tend to lean towards the male side of the spectrum. This just means that sometimes I identify more male and sometimes I identify as neutral, and other times I identify as female. I tend to identify most
            often as either neutral or male though. which is why I also fall under demiguy.</p>

        <p>Some of my passions in life are music, writing, and programming. These are things that I spend a lot of my time doing, and that I have devoted significant quantities of time and effort towards. These are things that I am both passionate about
            and that I care about greatly.</p>
        <P>I love to both make and to listen to music. I play the piano, and I previously played the violin. For me, making music is a de-stressor and it allows me to express my emotions in a way that I can't ever do through spoken words. It's my way of
            showing the world how I feel. It allows me to express myself in a way that no one will know exactly what is going on, but they will be able to hear the emotions that I am feeling.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I enjoy singing to and listening to all different genres of music. For me, music is both calming and uplifting, and it helps me to tune out everything around me and just focus in on what I am working on.</p>

        <p> I also love to program because I love the intuition involved, and the clear logic in it. It perfectly suits my logical mindset and it is precise and does not leave me guessing.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy writing, both creatively and analytically. I enjoy reading, and I enjoy creating fanfictions, which are works of creative writing that are based off of things that I have read or watched before. I also enjoy creating unique and original
            stories. Writing for me is a way to experience things that I never have/never will get a chance to experience.</p>
